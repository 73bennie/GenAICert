# Lesson 3.a – Model Types

### 🎯 Lesson Objective
Understand the four major types of generative AI models, how each functions, and which types are best suited for different applications.

---

## 🧠 What Is a Model?
- An **AI model**:
  - Takes in data
  - Uses algorithms to recognize patterns
  - Applies its learned patterns to **make decisions or predictions**
- The model type determines how it performs those tasks and what kinds of outputs it can generate.

## 🔢 The Four Core Model Types

| **Model Type**                   | **Primary Use**                                      | **Example Use Case**                                      |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Diffusion Models**            | Image generation and enhancement                     | Filling in missing image parts (inpainting), upscaling     |
| **Transformer Models**          | Text generation                                      | Chatbots, support agents, content creation (e.g., ChatGPT) |
| **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** | Portrait and avatar creation             | Marketing materials, character/face generation             |
| **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** | Anomaly detection                              | Identifying abnormal manufacturing output                  |

## 🎨 Diffusion Models

- Primarily used to **generate or repair images**
- Example:
  - Enhancing a low-resolution photo by generating new pixels that match the original style and content

> “A diffusion model is used mostly to generate images, such as using inpainting... Part of a diffusion model specialty is taking low resolution photos and making them high resolution.”

---

## ✍️ Transformer Models

- Specialized in **text generation**
- Power tools like ChatGPT
- Useful for applications such as:
  - Writing content
  - Customer service automation
  - Prompt-driven creative output

> Example:  
> _"Which AI model is well-suited for generating marketing materials for a smart home device company?"_  
> → Response: Transformer model

---

## 🧑‍🎨 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

- Ideal for **creating visual content**, often artistic in nature
- Used for:
  - Avatars
  - Portraits
  - Marketing graphics

> Prompt Example:  
> _“Create an avatar we can use in smart home device advertisements. Make the avatar look like a friendly female in her thirties.”_

- Result: Stylized avatar rendering that can be refined in other tools

---

## 🧪 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

- Excellent for **detecting anomalies** in data
- Example scenario:
  - Manufacturing expects 40 thermostats per cycle
  - An output of 35–45 is acceptable, but an output of 5 is a **flagged anomaly**
  - The model learns to **exclude such events** from normal forecasting

> “It is up to the AI model to spot the anomaly and consider that when predicting future production.”

## 💡 Key Insight

Each model type has strengths tailored to specific tasks:
- Use **Transformers** for intelligent text.
- Turn to **Diffusion** and **GANs** for images.
- Deploy **VAEs** for pattern recognition and error detection.
