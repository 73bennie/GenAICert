# Lesson 3.b – Key Terms

### 🎯 Lesson Objective
Learn essential terms used in generative AI so you can better understand how models work internally—and how to prepare your data accordingly for better outputs.

---

## 🧠 Neural Network

- Designed to mimic the structure of the **human brain’s neurons**
- Used for **pattern recognition**
  - Example: Identifying whether an outdoor photo was taken during the day or night

---

## 🧩 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- A specialized type of neural network used for **image and video analysis**
- Breaks images into **grids** to learn features, spacing, and relationships
- Example use case:  
  - **Facial recognition**, where the AI identifies facial elements such as:
    - Skin
    - Hair
    - Eyes
    - Nose
    - Ears
    - Lips
    - Texture

---

## 🔠 Tokenization

- The process of breaking sentences into:
  - Words
  - Sub-words
  - Characters
- These **tokens** are then assigned numerical values and processed by the model

> Example sentence:  
> _"There are more smart devices in homes now than ever."_  
> → Key tokens: `smart`, `devices`, `homes`, etc.  
> → These help the AI find patterns to answer future questions like:  
> _“What is the trend of smart devices in homes?”_

---

## 🌫️ Diffusion

- The act of **adding noise** to data during training  
- Common in **image models**

---

## 🔊 What Is Noise?

- Refers to **disturbances or variations** added to data during training
- Helps the model learn what a “clean” or high-quality version should look like

---

## 🖼️ Why Are Diffusion and Noise Important?

- Key to training models that:
  - **Fill in missing data**
  - **Enhance low-resolution images**
- To train a model to fix an image, it first must learn:
  - What a complete version looks like
  - How to recover from a “corrupted” version

> “To have an AI model fix something, it needs to know what something looks like that starts out well, but gets corrupted.”
