## 🧠 How Major AI Models Are Trained

| **Model**           | **Type**         | **Training Info**                                                                     |
|---------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ChatGPT**         | Text-based       | Trained via **unsupervised learning**—predicts next word in sentences                 |
| **Google Gemini**   | Text-based       | Uses a **multimodal** approach for diverse input/output formats                       |
| **Claude (Anthropic)** | Text-based    | Prioritizes **safety and ethical use**                                                |
| **Meta LLaMA**      | Text-based       | Designed for **research and model experimentation**                                   |
| **DALL·E**          | Image-based      | Generates images based on text descriptions                                           |
| **Adobe Firefly**   | Image-based      | Trained with **licensed and public domain** data—creates visuals and text effects     |

## 🕵️‍♂️ Model Training Transparency
- Companies keep much of their model training data and strategies private
- What is known helps users understand what a model is capable of generating

## 💡 Key Insight
Knowing how a model is trained helps determine which one is most appropriate for your specific task—whether it’s generating text, producing images, or interpreting multiple formats.
