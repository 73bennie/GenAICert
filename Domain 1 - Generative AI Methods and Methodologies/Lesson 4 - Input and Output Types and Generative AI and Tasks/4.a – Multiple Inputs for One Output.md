# Lesson 4.a – Multiple Inputs for One Output

### 🎯 Lesson Objective
Explore how generative AI can handle multiple input types—such as text, images, audio, and video—and how combining them enhances the quality and variety of outputs.

---

## 🔄 Input vs. Output in Generative AI

- Generative AI requires **input data** to produce outputs.
- Input types: **Text**, **Audio**, **Video**, **Images**
- Output types: Same categories, but prefixed with “generative,” e.g.:
  - Generative text
  - Generative video
  - Generative image
  - Generative audio

---

## 🧪 Example: Using Multiple Inputs

- In **ChatGPT**, a user uploads an image (from Adobe Firefly).
- Then types: _"Generate a caption for this image"_
- **Two input types** are used:
  - Text (the prompt)
  - Image (the uploaded content)
- The result: a generated caption.

> “This exercise is just one of many examples of using multiple inputs to get an output.”

## 🧠 Design Insight

- Using **multiple input types** improves the expressiveness and precision of the output.
- Creators should consider **all four input modes** when designing tasks, instead of limiting themselves to just text.
