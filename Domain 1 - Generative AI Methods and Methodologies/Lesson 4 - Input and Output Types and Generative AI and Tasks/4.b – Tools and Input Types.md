# Lesson 4.b – Tools and Input Types

### 🎯 Lesson Objective
Understand how different generative AI tools accept different input types and why knowing the strengths and limitations of each tool is essential.

---

## 🛠️ Tool Behavior and Input Flexibility

- Tools vary in what **input types** they accept and how they respond.

### ✅ Example: ChatGPT

- Input: Just an image → Response: Prompt to ask a question about the image
- Input: Image + text (e.g., _"Generate a caption for this image"_) → Response: Caption generated

### ❌ Audio Input Test

- Uploading an audio file and asking _"Transcribe the first line"_
  - ChatGPT does **not** transcribe it directly
  - Gemini doesn’t offer an upload option
  - However, Gemini does include a microphone icon
    - Spoken input like: _"Smart home devices save energy"_
    - It transcribes and expands on the spoken phrase

---

## 🖼️ Example: Adobe Firefly

- Primary tool: **Generate images from text**
- Example input: _"A picture of a smart refrigerator"_
  - Output: Multiple visual options to choose from

## 💡 Key Insight

To effectively use generative AI:
- Match your task to the **right tool**
- Know each platform’s **input-output strengths**
- Get familiar with how to engage multimodal capabilities where available
