## 🔍 Side-by-Side Breakdown

| **Feature**         | **Search Engines**                                  | **Generative AI**                                          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Input Style         | Keyword-based                                       | Natural language prompts                                    |
| Output              | Multiple sources of information                     | Single focused response                                     |
| Output Type         | List of external documents                          | Paragraphs, plans, summaries, etc.                          |
| Follow-up           | No retention of conversation context                | Remembers context within a session for iterative responses |
| Use Case Example    | “Marketing smart devices for homes” → many results | “Draft a marketing plan for smart devices in homes” → full plan |

## 💡 Guidance

- **Use a search engine when**:
  - You need multiple viewpoints or sources
  - You’re verifying facts or conducting research

- **Use generative AI when**:
  - You want a synthesized or drafted response
  - You’re brainstorming, outlining, or seeking specificity

## 🧠 Key Takeaway
Search engines gather options. Generative AI gives you a single starting point—or even a finished draft—to build from.
