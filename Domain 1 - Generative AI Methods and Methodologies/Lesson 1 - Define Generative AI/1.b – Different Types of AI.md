# Lesson 1.b â€“ Different Types of AI

### ðŸŽ¯ Lesson Objective
Understand what generative AI is by comparing it to other categories of artificial intelligence used for different tasks and data outputs.

---

## ðŸ¤– Generative AI
- Creates **new content** based on input prompts.
- Example: Text generation based on natural language instructions.

## ðŸ§  Types of AI and How They Differ

| **Type of AI**        | **Purpose**                                              | **Example**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Generative AI**     | Creates new content from prompts                         | Writing a paragraph about smart refrigerators                               |
| **Predictive AI**     | Forecasts future outcomes using trends                   | Projected smart home gadget sales                                           |
| **Discriminative AI** | Classifies data into categories                          | Likelihood to adopt smart tech by age and device usage                      |
| **Analytical AI**     | Extracts insights from existing data                     | Repair likelihood for smart door locks based on usage                       |
| **Statistical AI**    | Uses statistical analysis for insights                   | Energy savings between smart and non-smart homes                            |

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insight
While various AI types produce outputs, only **generative AI** produces *original, human-like content* directly from promptsâ€”making it uniquely suited for creation tasks rather than analysis or forecasting.
