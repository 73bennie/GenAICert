# Lesson 6.f – Consistency Limitations

### 🎯 Lesson Objective
Recognize the unpredictability of generative AI outputs and strategies for producing more consistent results.

---

## 🌀 Inconsistency Examples

- Image generation:
  - Prompt doesn’t specify clock times → AI shows **random, incorrect times**
- Vague prompts:
  - _“Explain a smart home device”_ → multiple devices
  - _“Explain one smart home device”_ → focused output

---

## 🔧 Fixes

- **Refine and resubmit prompts**
- Include specific constraints and desired structures
- Ensure **prompt consistency** across similar tasks

> Prompt clarity leads to output clarity.
