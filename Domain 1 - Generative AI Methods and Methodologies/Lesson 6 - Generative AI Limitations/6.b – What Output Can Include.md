## 🧠 Definitions

| **Issue**         | **Definition**                                                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bias**         | Leaning toward certain perspectives due to skewed training data                     |
| **Misinformation** | False information, shared unintentionally                                          |
| **Disinformation** | False information, shared with malicious intent                                   |
| **Hallucination** | Fabricated but convincing-sounding output not based on real data                   |

## ⚠️ Example Consideration

- Multiple companies shown in AI output? Likely **no bias**
- Missing or skewed representation? Possible **bias** at play

> Tip: Treat AI-generated output like **any online content**—fact check and interpret with care.
