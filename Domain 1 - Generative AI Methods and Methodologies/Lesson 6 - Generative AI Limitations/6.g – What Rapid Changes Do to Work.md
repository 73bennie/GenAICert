# Lesson 6.g â€“ What Rapid Changes Do to Work

### ðŸŽ¯ Lesson Objective
Understand how fast-changing data can quickly make AI outputs outdated and how to account for this in your workflow.

---

## ðŸ“‰ Freshness Matters

- LLMs often provide **stale data**, depending on their training cut-off or live access

### Examples

- AI returns **opening stock price**, not real-time value
- AI lists **older gaming laptop models** missing recent releases

---

## ðŸ§  Recommendation

- For **time-sensitive content**, prefer:
  - **Search engines**
  - **Real-time sources**
- Use generative AI for **structural or contextual help**, not live data

> Whatâ€™s accurate today may be outdated tomorrowâ€”especially in tech and finance.
