# Lesson 6.c â€“ Processing Power Needs

### ðŸŽ¯ Lesson Objective
Understand the hardware and connectivity requirements needed for efficient AI output generation.

---

## âš¡ Key Requirements

- **High GPU performance** â€“ For parallel processing and complex computation
- **High-speed internet** â€“ Essential for accessing cloud-based datasets and APIs

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Dataset Example

- **UC Irvine dataset** used to evaluate:
  - Household electric power consumption
  - Smart device behavior predictions

---

## ðŸ’¡ Takeaway

A slow device or weak connection leads to **laggy and inefficient** AI output. Power and bandwidth matter.
