# Lesson 6.a – Output Is Not Reliable

### 🎯 Lesson Objective
Understand the limitations of generative AI output, particularly around real-time accuracy and factual reliability.

---

## 🕒 Time-Sensitive Data

- LLMs may provide **outdated** or **incomplete** information.
- Example:
  - Prompt: _“What are the newest smart thermostats?”_
  - Output includes some models—but not all on the market

> Always **verify time-sensitive responses** using up-to-date sources.

## 🧠 Common Output Problems

- **Bias** – Unintended leanings based on training data
- **Misinformation** – Incorrect but unintentional data
- **Hallucinations** – Output that seems plausible but is completely fabricated

> LLMs often guess the next word, which can lead to wrong or misleading content. Always double-check fact-based responses.
