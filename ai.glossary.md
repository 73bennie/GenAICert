## ✍️ Prompting Techniques & AI Behaviors

- **Chain-of-Thought**  
  A series of prompts that takes a person through a step-by-step process to arrive at a desired outcome.  
- **Few-Shot Prompting**  
  The act of giving a generative AI engine guidelines and context for an output.  
- **Generate Knowledge**  
  A prompting technique in which a prompt generates a general answer on a topic, and then a follow-up prompt, more detailed, gets more specific information.  
- **Prompt Chaining**  
  A prompting technique in which one asks an AI tool follow-up questions based on information generated from a prompt.  
- **Refinement Algorithm**  
  An algorithm used to improve generated data, usually gradually.  
- **Reverse Prompting**  
  A prompting technique where the outcome of a situation is known and AI is used to learn what happened to arrive at that outcome.  
- **Role**  
  The act of adding a type of person, like an occupation title, to a generative AI output.  
- **Self-Consistency**  
  A prompting technique where the same prompt is used multiple times to generate different results.  
- **Zero-Shot Prompt**  
  A prompt with no direction or context.  
- **Persona**  
  The act of adding a personality trait to a generative AI output.

- **Interpolation**  
  A process in which video frames are enhanced to improve the smoothness and quality of a video.  
- **Noise Generation**  
  Disturbances added to data while an AI model is being trained, for the purpose of helping a model fill in data later, like for pixels on an image.  
- **Parameter**  
  A variable that contributes to how data is transformed from input to output.  
- **Sentiment**  
  An analysis of a statement and then ranking it as positive, negative, or neutral, depending on the tone in the statement.
