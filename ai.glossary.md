## ✍️ Prompting Techniques & AI Behaviors
**Chain-of-Thought** – A series of prompts that takes a person through a step-by-step process to arrive at a desired outcome.  
**Few-Shot Prompting** – The act of giving a generative AI engine guidelines and context for an output.  
**Generate Knowledge** – A prompting technique in which a prompt generates a general answer on a topic, and then a follow-up prompt, more detailed, gets more specific information.  
**Prompt Chaining** – A prompting technique in which one asks an AI tool follow-up questions based on information generated from a prompt.  
**Refinement Algorithm** – An algorithm used to improve generated data, usually gradually.  
**Reverse Prompting** – A prompting technique where the outcome of a situation is known and AI is used to learn what happened to arrive at that outcome.  
**Role** – The act of adding a type of person, like an occupation title, to a generative AI output.  
**Self-Consistency** – A prompting technique where the same prompt is used multiple times to generate different results.  
**Zero-Shot Prompt** – A prompt with no direction or context.  
**Persona** – The act of adding a personality trait to a generative AI output.  

## 💡 AI Reasoning, Behavior & Processing
**Algorithm** – A set of rules to be followed when doing process-oriented calculations.  
**Colorization** – A process in which black-and-white video gets color through the use of AI models.  
**Diffusion** – The act of adding noise to a data sample in an AI model.  
**Hyperparameter** – A parameter set before an AI model is trained.  
**Interpolation** – A process in which video frames are enhanced to improve the smoothness and quality of a video.  
**Noise Generation** – Disturbances added to data while an AI model is being trained, for the purpose of helping a model fill in data later, like for pixels on an image.  
**Parameter** – A variable that contributes to how data is transformed from input to output.  
**Sentiment** – An analysis of a statement and then ranking it as positive, negative, or neutral, depending on the tone in the statement.  

## 📊 Data, Metadata & Representation
**Dataset** – Data used to train an AI model.  
**Glossary** – A list of words to use to help a generative AI engine translate text from one language to another while keeping the proper context on words on the list.  
**Subtitle** – Words on a screen that match what is being said in a video.  
**Tag** – A keyword used to describe an image used in an AI model.  
**Template** – An AI output that can be used to generate multiple outputs with the same content except for different values for variables contained in the output.  
**Tokenization** – The act of breaking sentences down into words, subwords, and characters.  
**Visualization** – The act of inputting text and generating a chart, image, or other graphic.  

## 🧠 Types of AI
**Analytical AI** – A form of AI that gains insights from existing data.  
**Generative AI** – A form of artificial intelligence (AI) that creates content based on input prompts.  
**Predictive AI** – A form of AI that takes data and returns a future value based on that data and its trends.  
**Statistical AI** – A form of AI that gains insights from existing data purely from a statistical standpoint.  

## 🛡️ Ethics, Safety & Policy
**Bias** – A slanting or distortion of data used to favor a certain data aspect within AI, such as a product or demographic group.
