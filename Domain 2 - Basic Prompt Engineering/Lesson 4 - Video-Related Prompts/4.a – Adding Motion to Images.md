## ðŸ“¸ Motion Prompt Example

- Tool: NVideo AI
- Prompt: _"Create a 5-second video starting with a still image of a boat in water. I do not want sound in this video."_

### ðŸ’¡ Observations

- Default video zoomed into waterâ€”not exactly the desired motion
- Many AI tools add music and narration **unless told not to**
