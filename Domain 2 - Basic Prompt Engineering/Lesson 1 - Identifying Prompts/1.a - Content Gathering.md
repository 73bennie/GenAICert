# Lesson 1.a â€“ Content Gathering

### ðŸŽ¯ Lesson Objective
Learn how to use broad prompts to gather foundational information for a given topic before narrowing in on specifics.

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose of Content Gathering

- When supporting a project or business (e.g., smart home devices), start by asking broad, open-ended questions.
- Example prompt:
  - _"Give me details on all popular types of smart home devices and their uses."_

---

## âœ… Output from This Prompt

- Produces a list of common smart devices (e.g., thermostats, lights, speakers) along with basic descriptions.
- Establishes a **base layer of knowledge** for further exploration.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Strategy Tip

- **Start general**, then **drill down**.
  - Broad content gives inspiration for:
    - Summarization (Lesson 1.b)
    - Content creation and ideation (Lesson 1.c)
- Helps you ask more effective follow-up questions.
