# Lesson 2.a â€“ Reformatting Content

### ðŸŽ¯ Lesson Objective
Learn how to reformat AI-generated responses into different structures like charts or tables using prompt refinement.

---

## ðŸ“Š Reformatting Example

- Initial prompt: Asked ChatGPT about smart device installation over 5 years
  - Output: Paragraph format (not ideal for analysis)
- Refined prompt: _"Put this data in a chart or table format"_
  - Output: Tabular chart with year-by-year breakdown

---

## ðŸ§  Why It Matters

- Data displayed visually is easier to:
  - Compare
  - Present
  - Analyze for trends
- Rewording a prompt can shift output from **narrative** to **structured**

> Prompt wording makes the difference between a wall of text and a business-useful table.
