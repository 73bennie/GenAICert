# Lesson 2.c – Providing Visualizations

### 🎯 Lesson Objective
Understand how to convert text into visual formats like charts, diagrams, or image prompts.

---

## 🧠 Visualization Prompting

- Prompt: _"Provide a visualization of this overview"_  
  - Output: Ambiguous (could be chart, image, or image descriptions)
- More specific prompt:  
  - _"Use images to display what is being summarized"_

---

## 🖼️ Tool Example: Adobe Firefly

- Prompt: _"Generate the inside of a house with multiple smart home devices."_
- Output: Scene with labeled device areas (needs refinement)

## 💡 Prompt Clarity Matters

- Use explicit phrases like:
  - “Turn this into an image”
  - “Show this data as a pie chart”
- Clearer inputs = clearer visual outputs
