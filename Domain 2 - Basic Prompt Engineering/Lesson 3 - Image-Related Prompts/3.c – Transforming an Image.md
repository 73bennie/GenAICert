### 🎯 Lesson Objective
Discover how to modify an image using prompts—by adding, enhancing, or labeling content.

---

## 🔄 Use Case: Smart Device Image

- Tool: **Copilot**
- Upload: Image with smart home devices

### 🛠️ Transformation Prompts

1. _"Overlay smart home icons on these smart home devices"_  
   - Icons added, but visually cluttered
2. _"Add labels to each icon"_  
   - Labels added, but possibly difficult to read (e.g., all colored)

---

## ⚠️ Considerations

- Some edits may require **manual fine-tuning**
- **Photo editing apps** like Photoshop may still be needed for:
  - Clearer labeling
  - Fine-grained layout control

> Use generative AI for rapid edits—refine with traditional tools as needed.
